company location postion = clp
other = desp

map (key, value)

key = hash(rakuten+tokyo+engineer) = 0x123
value = set of hash = [0x1, 0x2, 0x3], [0x1, 0x2, 0x3, 0x4], [0x5, 0x6, 0x7] 

first round
- create index map (index, {md5(clp),md5(desp)})
- find 100 top most pattern of clp = map(md5(clp),occurance) -- or using threshold -- O(n)
- in each of 100 top clp, find top 100 desp = map(md5(desp),occurrance) -- or using threshold
- now have 100x100 pattern of most occurance of clp x desp
- start categorize the job from index 1 to all --> map(pattern,count)
